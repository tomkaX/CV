I have made this into a Jekyll Theme. Checkout the live demo [here](https://tomkax.github.io/CV).


## Installation

* [Fork](https://github.com/tomkax/CV/fork) the repository
* Go to settings and set master branch as Github Pages source.
* Your new site should be ready at `https://<username>.github.io/CV/`
* Printable version of the site can be found at `https://<username>.github.io/CV/print`. Use a third party link https://pdflayer.com/, https://www.web2pdfconvert.com/ etc to get the printable PDF.

Change all the details from one place: ``_data/data.yml``

## To preview/edit localy with docker

```sh
docker-compose up
```

*docker-compose.yml* file is used to create a container that is reachable under http://localhost:4000.
Changes *_data/data.yml* will be visible after a while.
